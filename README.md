# File-Integrity-Checker-
The File Integrity Checker calculates SHA-256 hashes for every file in a chosen folder to detect changes. It uses Python’s os module to list files and hashlib to generate secure hashes. By comparing hashes from different runs, users can spot modified, added, or deleted files, making it a simple integrity-monitoring tool.
